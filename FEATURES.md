# Feature List

Features and planned future features are listed below, in no particular order. This list also functions somewhat like a roadmap.

For the most part, this list concerns what users would see, not what the codebase has. For example:
- There is no mention of reduction or oxidation in the codebase, yet redox reactions are possible.
- Activation energy is counted in the codebase, yet that code has no effect so far.

This list is non-exhaustive- more planned future features may be added as I think about them.

However, any chemistry-related feature not listed here is likely too advanced for the scope of this project.
