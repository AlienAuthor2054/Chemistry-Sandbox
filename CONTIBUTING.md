# Contributing Guidelines

As always, please check for duplicate issues or pull requests before posting them.

I aim to respond to issues and pull requests at least once a day.

## Issues

- Post bug reports as an issue, unless its fix is in the feature list.
- New feature proposals should only propose features not in the feature list.
- Suggestions (enchancement proposals) may be posted as an issue.
- Issues also serve to discuss proposed changes, especially major ones.

## Pull Requests

- For non-trivial changes, make sure to test your changes.
- For major changes, please open an issue first.
